# The Passionate Programmer by Chad Fowler

Though there were moments where Chad rubbed me the wrong way, I feel like I'm taking quite a bit of value with me.  Having worked a few years in a very corporate world, some of his tips and chapters supported the lessons I've picked along the way.  With those "tell me something I dont know" topics aside. I'm still left with a handful of deep thoughts that will make me a more passionate and aware software developer but also more passionate and aware person.  

### Lessons I hope to put into practice:
#####*(tips/concepts paraphrased)*


##### 1. Surround myself with people who will make me better
 We either elevate ourselves to "hang" with the people around us or we go down to their level.  Theres an obvious choice here if your goal is to be successful.

#### 2. Be more fluid.
Life and ESPECIALLY technology is and SHOULD be constantly changing. It's a pointless and exhausting battle to try to remain static somewhere. Instead of making today better than yesterday, you're trying to make today like yesterday. The more rigid you are when approaching and taking on the new day, the more resistance you're going to feel. You're going to overlook the small wins. You're not going to have a lasting and thriving career in tech.

####3. Make your mark and share it.
Having people know you who you are opens up the door to allow you to get to what you're good at without having to first prove your capabilities. It's going to you more opportunities to work your magic. Show people the awesome you're doing because if you're not tooting your own horn, no one will.
