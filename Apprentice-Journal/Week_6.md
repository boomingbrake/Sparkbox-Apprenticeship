# Week 6

## Snot that big of a deal

Mid week, I had an epson salt incidence, that I'm blaming for triggering a full blown sinus attack on my brain. Me writing this today stands as a survival tale.  I am not a victim, I am a fighter, a survivor, and I am clearly in denial that changing weather patterns flare my allergies.

Last week, was, in my opinion, the first week where the apprentices were doing their own thing. I was playing around with my Game of Games application that is a driver to play other games. This application is my baby.  It's been a playground for class organization and relationships. I'm glad it was made relevant again to test input interaction.  A fake console was created to handle the game's 'puts' and 'gets' requirements that kept a log of messages and questions that could be referenced later in my spec to test that the game flow happened as desired. I was also challenged by the Ryan to add multi player capabilities.  This was accomplished by adding a new array to my game class to store player names and a few additional questions were added to the greet method that is triggered at the beginning of 'play.'

In a pairing on Friday, I was able to implement the dynamically generated list of available games. The available_games array was created to house the instances of each available game.  This gave my mini application a desired 'drop in' feature. I require a few standard conventions like file name, class name, as well as a 'play' method that accepts a player name parameter. After that, if you drop a game file into the games folder, it'll automatically be added to the Game of Games, available for play.

This week, I'm going to try to dig further into the topic of Design Patterns from last week's Apprentice Talk. I'm also going to force myself to conquer Conway's Game of Life, that I've rendered as uninteresting for some reason.
