# Week 4

## "red, green, refactor"

This week we covered testing.  Or I should say we extended on testing.  I have to admit, Ruby and I have hit a rough patch this week.  I've felt like a champion lately in the command line and really getting into Git'n it, but this testing has taken me down a few pegs. Getting into the testing first mindset has been a struggle, and I finding it challenging to break it down to the basics, then building out.  Kasey gave me a few tips this week dealing with rspec and starting slow.  

Nate, bless his heart, has been great chatting things out with me.  Even though, we hardly know what the other is talking about, it's been helping me process and work things out in my head.  Without him, I'd be talking to myself AND that's what crazy people do.  How I see it, the more we talk gibberish, the quicker we learn to talk.

It's been an exhaustingly awesome 4 weeks at Sparkbox. Going snowshoeing in Michigan this Friday. Find some nature zen over the weekend, and come back Monday ready to kick more butt, and make up to Ruby.
