# Week 5

## 3 strikes, You're OUT

Cruising full steam ahead with Ruby and being a practitioner of the T(est)D(riven)D(evelopment) process. I think I've reach the point this week, where I'm in a common law marriage with the Bowling Kata, Uncle Bob is my father, and I am qualified to be the official bowling scorekeeper of the 2020 Summer Olympics.  

Okay, I'm done being dramatic. This week, has given me a chance to warm up to TDD unit testing.  I struggled with it last week, but I'm feeling a lot better about it (Thanks Yock!). Muscle memory is building when it comes to working with my development environment; pushing to GitHub, access through my console, atom, and RUBY. Though I still remain uninterested in bowling, Uncle Bob's kata has invited me to explore the Array class, as well as presenting me with a few opportunities to look into my file/code organization.

A month into this Apprenticeship, I'm embracing and enjoying the fact that I'm learning something new every 5 minutes. I've started reading through Apprenticeship Patterns, referencing the 'Emptying the Cup' concept, I'm here to learn everything because my cup is not full. First thing you quickly learn as a developer, is that there is always something new to learn, and that it's important to keep room in your cup.
