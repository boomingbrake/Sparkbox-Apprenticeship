#Week 12 (and maybe a few before)

###Marky Markup and the Funky Bunch

Theres no better test to one's skills when given a blank slate and asked to make something.
I fully understand as a member of the tech field, I'm going to be constantly in the
position to learn the newest technology as well as keeping a grasp on what everything
else out there was probably written on, BUT wow.  My CSS is rusty.  

The one thing I have going for me, and I feel this makes me valuable for any team, is
that I don't have any CONCRETE bad habits (CSS and beyond).  I'm not attached to any process,
so my first demand when facing a problem is "show me a cool way of do this."

I do have a coding style though.  I like simple and clean, so my search for a solution will
go through this "Simple and Clean" coding style filter.  I'm finding this is easier to achieve when writing functional
code (in javascript, ruby, etc etc etc) than style with CSS.  The phrase "CSS is Hacky" holds SO TRUE.
So this is my current struggle, "Does it really require that much code to get my content centered?"
