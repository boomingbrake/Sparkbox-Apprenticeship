#Week 7

###Aren't we all playing the game of life to a certain extent?


~~Alternative Title: Call me Yogi Berra. Simply put, I'm deep AF.~~

This week I forced myself to conquer the Game of Life kata.  I read it once a month ago, wasn't as impressed as the rest of the world of it's magic and wonder, decided that it was for future Brittany to deal with.

I wrestled with it for a few good days and with the first round under my belt, and I have to admit, it's pretty cool. I can see the value in it now from a programming stand point.  Just as the grid of life can be endless, as can your approach. Plus its so empowering to create life. I look forward to exploring more solutions to it's challenge.  

I also finished the Passionate Programmer, still riding the high, I'm feeling pretty enlightened. Tad exaggeration there, but he made some really great points in how to pursue a passionate career.  Though, I also see how his "tips" in the wrong hands can create an unbearable egomaniac.  Balance is key here.  Be confident in your value, love it, share it, stay focused on having a healthy balance of it.  My write up on the book goes into the tips that I will take with me on forward.

Great week. Dug deeper into Ruby.  Learning how to be a passionate person. Food as been ON POINT.  Conversation (even the most casual) has been very thought provoking.
